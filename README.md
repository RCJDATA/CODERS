This code aims to answer the question: how much toothpaste is sold monthly in Brazil?
The data source is IBGE, a trustful institution and the official one in Brazil.
The process is simple just converting the original data sales in kg per year to units per month.
Assumptions: 
1- the unit package contains 90 g 
2 -the yearly growth rate from year 2005 to 2013 was considered to forecast the 2020 toothpaste sales
It is part of a grant program BECAS [SantanderCoders]
